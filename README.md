# Capstone-Magic-Mirror README

## Overview

Welcome to the code repository for the Smart Mirror Device! This project is designed to create a smart mirror that displays useful information, such as time, date, weather, calendar events, and more, while also providing a mirror reflection. This README will guide you through the codebase, its functionality, and how to get started.

## Features

- Displays current time and date.
- Retrieves and displays weather information for a specified location.
- Integrates with Google Calendar to show upcoming events.
- Provides a reflective mirror surface when not displaying information.
- Supports voice control for basic commands.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Magic Mirror code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-mirror.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).

3. Configure the application (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

4. Run the code on your Raspberry Pi or preferred hardware platform.

## Dependencies

The Smart Mirror Device code relies on the following dependencies:

- Raspberry Pi (or compatible hardware)
- Python 3.x
- [MagicMirror²](https://magicmirror.builders/)
- OpenWeatherMap API Key (for weather information)
- Google Calendar API credentials (for calendar events)
- Microphone and speaker for voice control (optional)

Make sure to install and configure these dependencies before using the code.

## Configuration

1. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.js` for MagicMirror²) to specify settings such as weather location, calendar integration, and voice control options.

2. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key and Google Calendar API credentials to the configuration file.

3. Customize the appearance and modules displayed on the mirror by editing the configuration file.

## Usage

To use the Smart Mirror Device:

1. Power on your Raspberry Pi or hardware platform.

2. Ensure that the code is set to run at startup or manually start it:

   ```shell
   cd /path/to/smart-mirror
   python3 smart_mirror.py
   ```

3. Your smart mirror should now display the time, date, weather, and calendar events based on your configuration.

4. Optionally, use voice commands (if configured) to interact with the mirror.

## Customization

You can customize the Smart Mirror Device in the following ways:

- Modify the appearance and layout by editing the configuration file (e.g., `config.js` for MagicMirror²).
- Add or remove modules to display different information.
- Customize voice commands and responses (if using voice control).
- Experiment with additional features and integrations.
